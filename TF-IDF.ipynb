    "TF*IDF method:\n",
    "It is the simplest method to implement. However the top match for \"best bbq\" was just a review with \"bbq\" ie the rarer term, mentioned 6 times which is to be expected given that rarer terms have large IDF. There was no penalty for a longer document, top scoring doc is a 358 word review, it scores high only because of the rarer term mentioned more number of times, however this approch will skew results towards longer documents which will obviously mention a term more often. An approach with some doc normalisation will give better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine Method: \n",
    "This method takes care of document normalisation by using the doc_mag (the length of the doc to normalise the tf*idf score).\n",
    "Takes more computation because tf idf score is to be calculated for each term in each doc for normalisation.\n",
    "Cosine method's highest rated review for \"best bbq\" is just a short document with one term ie \"best\" even though \"best\" has lower idf than \"bbq\". Short doc length is over weighted/preferred in cosine approach. This approach severely penalises documents that are slightly longer and chooses one of the shortest docs as the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "BM-25: \n",
    "Seems to be the best method in terms of computation cycles and extracting most important document.\n",
    "Does not involve either the computation intensive ways of cosine doc normalisation (normalisation is with simple doc length) nor is it heavily skewed in favor of rarer terms.\n",
    "Best rated document for \"best bbq\" was a relatively short doc length of 110 words, with bbq freq=4 and best freq=1. This was the most pertinent and relevant doc for the given query."
